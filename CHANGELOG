# 0.01

* Pre-release. Everything is changing very rapidly; don't depend on anything working or staying stable.

# 0.02

* Migrate all of the files for compiling DWIN LCD display firmware into
[another project](https://gitlab.com/capekoviroboti/ender3v2-customizer). This
repo now focuses exclusively on documentation and `.h` files for compiling
Marlin with support for a customized bootscreen on printers with
simple graphical LCDs.
